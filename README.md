## 📋 About opencode-ralph-rlm

opencode-ralph-rlm is a software tool designed to help users improve coding projects with AI assistance. It combines two main features: the Ralph outer loop and the RLM inner loop. These work together to help develop programs step-by-step, using files to keep things organized. The tool also supports using smaller helper programs, called sub-agents, to break down tasks.

This makes coding easier and more efficient, especially for larger projects. While it is built with advanced technology, you do not need programming knowledge to use the main features. The tool follows a clear process, helps prevent errors, and encourages better code management.

## 🧭 How It Works

opencode-ralph-rlm helps with coding projects by using AI to run two loops:

- **Ralph Outer Loop:** This looks at your whole project step-by-step. It guides the bigger picture and manages tasks in sequence.
- **RLM Inner Loop:** This works inside each step to solve smaller details. It uses a recursive language model to check and improve code bit by bit.

The tool reads and writes files as its main way to store information. This file-first method keeps everything clear and ensures changes are easy to track and manage.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Iterative AI Development:** The software develops code by repeating small improvements until the desired result is reached.
- **File-First Discipline:** All work happens through files, making the process organized and easy to follow.
- **Sub-Agent Support:** The app can use mini helpers (sub-agents) to take on smaller tasks, speeding up work.
- **Simple Interface:** Designed for both beginners and experienced users with minimal setup.
- **Supports Multiple Project Types:** Works with different programming languages and file structures.
- **Built with TypeScript:** Ensures reliable and readable code inside the app.
- **Open Source and Extensible:** Community-driven and customizable for advanced users.
